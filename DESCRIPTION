Title: Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling of Power Laws using brms

Description: Estimates the exponent of a power law from one or more samples using Generalized (non)-linear mixed models in brms.
    The package adds a doubly-truncated Pareto family to brms. It will also simulate data from the doubly-truncated Pareto and
    and generate plots of posterior fits to data. Most other built-in features of brms, such as conditional_effects() and posterior
    sampoing will also work.
